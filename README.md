ESHA & KYLE'S WEDDING EVENT GUIDE

https://complicationlamp.github.io/


SUMMARY:
The app is designed to be a simple guide to my wedding coming up in October 2018. The primary goal was to clearify where events on different days would be taking place. As the traditions of this wedding, Indian, will be a new format for most of my family additional details will popup along the flow through the app by clicking on the arrow marker. A text box tells the user to click on a day to get event details and a marker to get cultural significance. 

MAKE YOUR OWN ROUTE: The route is pre set from San Jose airport and driving to the events, with the directions of how to drive listed below. The interactive portion of this webpage is the dragable route option. By dragging the the red markers you can create your own side trips along the way; the second snapshot shows this along with the updated driving directions below.
