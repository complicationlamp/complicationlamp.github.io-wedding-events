ESHA & KYLE'S WEDDING EVENT GUIDE

https://complicationlamp.github.io/


SUMMARY:
The app is designed to be a simple guide to my wedding coming up in October 2018. The primary goal was to clearify where events on different days would be taking place. As the traditions of this wedding, Indian, will be a new format for most of my family additional details will popup along the flow through the app. A text box tells the user to click on a day to get event details and a marker to get cultural significance. On click map api will zoom into area of intrest, and also pulls  wether json information for the area, dispalyed next to the events.
